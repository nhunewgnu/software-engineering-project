# Accessing the AWS Instance

1. Make sure that you have a private key file, obtain the file from the repository by copy and paste into a text file and name that 'unibot.pem'
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing your "unibot.pem" private key file.
4. Run this command first to ensure that the key is not publicly viewable
```
chmod 400 unibot.pem
```
5. Then run the following command to access your AWS instance via SSH:
```
ssh -i "unibot.pem" ec2-user@ec2-52-90-221-156.compute-1.amazonaws.com
```

# Navigating the Instance

1. After logging in to the instance, you will be in your home directory (`/home/ec2-user`).
2. Use basic Linux commands like `cd`, `ls`, and `mkdir` to navigate and manage directories and files on the instance.
3. There should already be a repository for the project but in case there is not

# Cloning from GitHub

1. First, install Git on your instance if you haven't already:
```
sudo yum install git
```
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone your repository.
3. Run the following command to clone the repository, replacing "your-repo-url.git" with the actual URL of your repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/nhunewgnu/software-engineering-project.git
```


# Adding and Committing Files to GitHub

1. Make any necessary changes to your files and save them.
2. Use the following command to stage your changes:

```
git add file1 file2 file3
```

Replace "file1 file2 file3" with the actual names of the files you want to stage. You can also use `git add .` to stage all changes in the repository.

3. Commit your changes with a descriptive message:
```
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
```

4. Finally, push your changes to the remote repository:
```
git push origin main
```
Note: If you have not set up your Git credentials, you might need to configure them using the following commands:

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
```
# Connecting Front & Back end
We created an AWS instance to host the chatbot on, here's what we used to run this bot: 

**FLASK**

Flask is a micro web framework for Python that is used to build web applications. It provides a simple and lightweight way to create web applications and APIs, and is suitable for small to medium-sized projects. Flask uses the WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) interface to communicate with the web server.

**NGINX**

Nginx is a web server that is commonly used to serve static files, act as a reverse proxy for HTTP, HTTPS, and other protocols, and to perform load balancing. Nginx is known for its high performance and stability, and is used by many websites and web applications.

**GUNICORN**

Gunicorn is a pre-fork worker model based server for serving Python applications. It is designed to handle multiple requests in parallel and is commonly used to run Flask and other Python web applications. Gunicorn is typically used behind a reverse proxy, such as Nginx, to handle incoming HTTP requests and to serve the responses generated by the Python application.

**WHY THESE 3**

All three of these technologies are often used together on AWS because they provide a powerful and flexible way to serve web applications. Flask provides a simple and lightweight way to build the application logic, Gunicorn provides efficient and scalable serving of the application, and Nginx provides a fast and reliable reverse proxy for incoming requests. By using these technologies together, we can build and deploy web applications that are fast, scalable, and production-ready, and that can be easily managed and maintained on AWS.

# How to run 

1. First, run this command to check the status of Nginx:
```
sudo systemctl status nginx
```
If nginx is not running, run this command to start nginx up:

```
sudo systemctl start nginx
```
2. Next, check if there are any issues with your Nginx configuration:
```
sudo nginx -t
```
3. Make sure Gunicorn is running:
```
ps aux | grep gunicorn
```
If Gunicorn is not running, start it with this command:
```
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app --daemon
```
4.) Run your Flask app in the background: 
```
nohup python3 app.py &
```
